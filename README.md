# AI algorithms 
These folders contain my implementations of different AI algorithms written in Python. The algorithms are:
 - A genetic algorithm responsible for planning connections on a PCB Board, so that they don't intersect
 - Solutions for two CSP problems: Einstein's Riddle and Graph Coloring Problem
 - A mancala implementation based on minimax algorithm
 - Text classification using Naive Bayes and SVMs
